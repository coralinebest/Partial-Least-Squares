# Partial-Least-Squares


## Overview

This project focuses on the implementation and evaluation of the Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression algorithm. PLS is a statistical method used for regression and classification, known for its effectiveness in handling high-dimensional data, multicollinearity, and situations with more predictors than observations.

## Key Findings

- PLS regression is a robust algorithm, excelling in scenarios with complex data structures.
- Versatility in handling multicollinearity and dimensionality reduction makes PLS suitable for various applications.
- The iterative nature of PLS facilitates effective model building, allowing for superior predictive accuracy.

## Implementation

- The project utilizes a macroeconomic dataset with 588 monthly observations, covering a range of variables.
- PLS regression is implemented in Python, with a focus on forecasting industrial production in the manufacturing sector.
- The algorithm's interpretability is explored through factor analysis, providing insights into the grouping of variables.


## Application of PLS Regression

- The project showcases the application of PLS regression in forecasting industrial production, using a combination of univariate and bivariate models.
- Factor loadings analysis provides insights into the composition of factors, aiding in the interpretation of model outputs.
- One-month-ahead forecasts using a rolling window approach demonstrate the predictive accuracy of PLS regression.

## Conclusion

- PLS regression proves to be a valuable tool in handling complex datasets and making accurate predictions in the economic domain.
- While challenges such as interpretability and sensitivity to outliers exist, the advantages of PLS, including multicollinearity handling and dimensionality reduction, make it a versatile choice for certain scenarios.
